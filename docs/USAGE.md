# FuelTracker Usage

## Statistics Panel
The main window now contains a dockable **Statistics** panel on the right. It
shows the average kilometres per litre (`km/L`) and the cost per kilometre
(`à¸¿/km`) for the currently selected vehicle. The panel updates automatically
whenever an entry is added or deleted.

## Automatic Backups
On application exit the database is copied to
`~/.fueltracker/backups/YY-MM-DD_HHMM.db`. Up to 30 recent backups are kept and
older files are removed automatically.
